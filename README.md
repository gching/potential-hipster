Objectifies and makes API more friendly for a non-disclosed company!

## Problem Statement
Currently, most client libraries offered only provide methods that simply wrap the end points of the API and requires the user to have a very deep understanding about the API. Given this, it is hard for a user to get started (can't remember a better word, uptake?) and developing for their applications and projects. At the same time, the client libraries very much resembles doing it by REST, so all in all, does not provide the anything more different then simply doing RESTful calls.

## Solution
Potential-Hipster is an architecture for the client libraries to help objectify and properly illustrate the backend of "diclosed company". With this shift, the user does not need to deeply understand API and would rather interact with these objects without knowing any endpoints.
